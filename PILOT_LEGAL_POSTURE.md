Legal posture for pilot formally defined and binding.

**Effective Date**: 2026-01-24

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the legal posture of the FrostDesk pilot.

## 2. Non-Autonomous AI Declaration

**FrostDesk does not operate any autonomous artificial intelligence.**

- The AI does not act independently
- The AI does not make decisions
- The AI does not execute actions
- The AI does not communicate with users autonomously

**The AI functions exclusively as a decision-support and drafting tool.**

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

**All externally visible actions require explicit human involvement.**

- Messages are sent only by humans
- Bookings are confirmed only by humans
- Pricing and availability are communicated only by humans
- Approvals are intentional and logged

**No AI output produces effects without human confirmation.**

## 4. No Automated Decisions

**The pilot includes no automated decisions of any kind.**

Specifically excluded are:

- Automated bookings

- Automated pricing
- Automated policy enforcement

**All decisions remain under human control.**

## 5. No Payments or Financial Transactions

**The pilot does not support:**

- Payment initiation
- Payment confirmation
- Refunds
- Invoicing
- Financial commitments

**FrostDesk does not process or authorize any financial transaction during the pilot.**

## 6. No Irreversible Actions

**The system performs no irreversible actions.**

- No automated state changes
- No silent mutations
- No external system writes by AI

**All actions are auditable, reversible, and attributable.**

## 7. Responsibility and Accountability

**Responsibility is explicitly assigned to human roles.**

- AI holds no responsibility
- AI bears no liability
- Human operators are accountable for actions taken
- All actions are logged with identity, timestamp, and context

## 8. Liability Posture

**During the pilot:**

- FrostDesk acts as a support tool
- FrostDesk does not act as an agent
- FrostDesk does not enter contracts

**All communications are informational and subject to human verification.**

## 9. Legal Freeze

**This legal posture is fixed for the duration of the pilot.**

Any modification requires a new governance block and explicit approval.
