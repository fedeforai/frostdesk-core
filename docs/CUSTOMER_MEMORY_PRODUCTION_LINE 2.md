# Customer Memory — Production Line

**Purpose:** Path to product-market ready without skipping steps.  
**Principle:** Many startups fail by accelerating before truth is in production.

---

## Phase 1 — Truth in production *(where you are now)*

**Goal:**
- The model exists in prod.
- The UI does not lie.
- Every link is explainable.

**Deliverables:**
- CM-1 + CM-2 implemented.
- No aggressive automation.
- No marketing-only features.

This phase is not for selling; it is for **stabilizing**.

---

## Phase 2 — Operational usefulness (CM-3 + CM-4)

**Only when Phase 1 is actually complete.**

**CM-3 — Customer History View**  
Immediate value for the instructor:
- “Have I seen them before?”
- “How many lessons?”
- “When last time?”

No intelligence. Only facts.

**CM-4 — Internal Notes**  
Human memory, not AI:
- Private notes.
- Manual edit.
- Audit on update.

Here the product becomes **useful every day**.

---

## Phase 3 — Trust, not prediction (CM-5)

- Simple signals.
- No scoring.
- No AI making decisions.

Purpose: support **better decisions**, not delegate them.

---

## Phase 4 — Hardening & scale (CM-6)

**Only when:**
- Instructors use it for real.
- You have real data.
- Patterns are clear.

Focus: indexes, performance, stress tests, security.

---

## Phase 5 — Market ready

A product is market ready when:
- It does not break when used “wrong”.
- It always explains what happened.
- It never surprises.
- It can grow without changing foundations.

Then you can: sell, scale, add real AI.

---

## TL;DR

- The hard part (design + plan) is done.
- The risk is **ruining it by rushing**.

If you follow this production line:
- You don’t redo the model.
- You don’t rewrite the UI.
- You don’t explain bugs to investors.
